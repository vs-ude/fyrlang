# Fyrlang

Fyr is a modern systems programming language that combines the versatility of C with the ease and safety of application programming languages like Java, Go or TypeScript. Like C/C++, Fyr can be used for low-level hardware-oriented programming and high-level application programming. In contrast to C, the Fyr compiler guarantees memory safety and thread safety at compilation time.  

Fyr is designed to implement all tiers of distributed IoT applications, i.e. embedded devices, server-side code and the Web UI. Furthermore, it can be combined with existing C and JavaScript code.  

This is a complete rewrite using Go as a base. We found that the original design was lacking in some aspects, which would have required architectural changes. This made a rewrite an easier solution.
Using Go as a base allows gives us more freedom in the implementation and improves performance drastically.

Please do not use this version as of now, as it is very much unfinished.
